# King-Camino-Project-2
Project 2 for St558 
Authors: Tommy King and Steph Camino

## Purpose  

In this repo you will find code for this project in the Project-2.Rmd file. The file starts off accessing data reguarding the prediction of number of shares in social networks from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity). Afterwards, there is some brief exploratory data analysis where summary statistics and plots are created. Four models are then made, two linear regression models, one random forest model, and one boosted tree model. Lastly, all four models are compared and the winning model is chosen based off of RMSE.
